#Running the bot

Before you first launch the bot you need to run the file "setup.bat" or "setup.command". You can't miss it. This will install all the dependencies that bot needs to run.

To run the bot, Just execute the file "start.bat" or "start.command".

#Configuration File config.json

  config.json has four properties

  1. token
    - this is the login token for your bot
  2. prefix
    - this is the symbol the bot uses to recognize commands. This is set to "!" by default
  3. maxRollsPerDie
    - This is the max number per dice type that can be rolled in a given roll command. Set to 20 by default. Commands that don't respect the roll limit will be aborted and send an error message to the discord chat.
